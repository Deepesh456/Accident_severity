# Accident Severity Prediction Chatbot

An interactive Streamlit-based chatbot that predicts the severity of a road accident â€” **Fatal**, **Serious**, or **Slight Injury** â€” based on various driver, vehicle, and environmental conditions. Built using machine learning models trained on real-world accident datasets.

---

## Project Overview
---
This project is designed to assist traffic authorities, emergency response teams, and researchers in predicting accident outcomes based on reported incident details. It features a clean web-based UI, real-time predictions, and robust backend preprocessing and modeling.

---

## Features

- Real-time accident severity prediction
- Trained ML model with class balancing
- Multi-category input selection (e.g., weather, road type, driver experience)
- Streamlit interface with prediction feedback
- Model, scaler, and encoders saved using `pickle`
- Handles unseen user inputs gracefully
